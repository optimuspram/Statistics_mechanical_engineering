This is a collection of R Markdown files that I use for teaching MS 2200 (Statistics) at Institut Teknologi Bandung. They are written in Bahasa Indonesia for now. You can open the R Markdown files 
using Rstudio.

Note: Github does not display R Markdown files. Instead, you can view the PDF files in Github or the HTML files using htmlpreview.github.io
